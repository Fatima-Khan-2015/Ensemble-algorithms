# Ensemble-algorithms
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating three powerful ensemble learning algorithms in Machine Learning: Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting. These algorithms are widely used for both classification and regression tasks due to their ability to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting compared to single models.

The notebook covers:

Random Forest: An ensemble of decision trees trained on random subsets of data and features, improving stability and accuracy.

AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting): Sequentially builds weak learners, giving more weight to misclassified samples to improve performance.

Gradient Boosting: Optimizes models by minimizing the loss function through additive modeling and gradient descent techniques.

Each section includes:

Explanation of the algorithmâ€™s working principle

Python implementation using scikit-learn

Application on sample datasets

Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualization of results and decision boundaries

The project is implemented in Python with libraries including scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. It serves as a practical resource for understanding and comparing different ensemble techniques, making it valuable for both beginners and practitioners in machine learning.
